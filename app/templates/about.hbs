      Welcome. My name is Long Tran and I am fashion designer turned web developer.
      I recently finished an immersive 19-week coding bootcamp (Devbootcamp) in the bay,
      and am now looking for new opportunities that will challenge my newly gained skills
      and also tie-in skills from my design background.
